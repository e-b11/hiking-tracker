You can create your own account, or you can see some stored hikes under u: emma and p: emma.
You must login to view, add, update, or delete hikes. The recommendations page is available to everyone though.

The website is deployed on Emma Bastian's student learner lab. If the website is not working, please let her know, and she can start the lab up. She has had websites that work even when the lab is not active.
